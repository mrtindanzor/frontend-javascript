# TypeScript Namespace Practice

This project demonstrates how to use **TypeScript namespaces**, interfaces, and classes across multiple files. It also includes a function that returns different classes based on input.

## Concepts Covered
- Namespaces and namespace merging
- Splitting namespaces across multiple files
- Interfaces and class structure in TypeScript
- Conditional return types based on input
- Using `/// <reference />` for multi-file namespace projects

## Example Features
- `Subjects` namespace for defining teachers and subjects
- `Teacher` interface and extended teacher types
- Subject classes such as `Cpp` with custom logic
- `createEmployee` function that returns `Teacher` or `Director` based on salary
